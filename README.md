# Luxon framework documentation
Luxon is powerful and minimal framework and provides a solid foundation for your next website. All Luxon's core modules are JSdoc'ed so that your code editor can provide you with helpful information about each method. I use Visual Studio Code with PHP Intelephense extension and it supports JSdoc/PHPdoc.\
\
**Warning:** Luxon is a work in progress project and if you decide to use it, you should\
expect your web application to break after updates.
